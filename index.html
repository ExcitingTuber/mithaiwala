                            Kaju katli, also known as kaju barfi, is an Indian dessert, originating in the Deccan and is popularly consumed throughout north India.   
                            Cashew nuts are ground into a fine powder, mixed with sugar syrup, and then cooked until it forms a dough-like consistency. This dough is then rolled out, flattened, and cut into diamond-shaped pieces. Finally, it's garnished with silver leaf (varak) and sometimes with chopped nuts like pistachios or almonds.

                            Gulab Jamun is a popular dessert in India and other South Asian countries. It's essentially soft, deep-fried dumplings made of milk solids (khoya or mawa), flour, and a leavening agent, usually soaked in a sugar syrup flavored with rose water, cardamom, saffron, and sometimes garnished with chopped nuts like pistachios or almonds. To make Gulab Jamun, the milk solids and flour are kneaded into a smooth dough, then shaped into small balls. These balls are deep-fried until golden brown, and then soaked in a warm sugar syrup.The syrup permeates the dumplings, giving them their characteristic sweet and fragrant taste.Gulab Jamun can be served warm or at room temperature, and it's often enjoyed on special occasions such as festivals, weddings, and celebrations. It's loved for its rich, indulgent flavor and melt-in-your-mouth texture.

                            Laddu, also spelled as Ladoo, is a popular and traditional Indian sweet that comes in various forms and flavors. It is essentially a round-shaped sweet made by combining different ingredients like flour, semolina, chickpea flour (besan), ground nuts, or grated coconut with sweeteners like sugar, jaggery (unrefined cane sugar), or honey. Ghee (clarified butter) is often used to bind the ingredients together.
